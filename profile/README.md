Half Point Studio
---
A small and creative studio focused on developing and launching indie hacking products. Our goal is to create innovative solutions that solve real problems for people while generating sustainable revenue streams for ourselves.


What We Do
---
At our studio, we focus on building simple yet powerful software products. 
These can range from niche SaaS applications to games or even browser extensions. 
The common thread between all of our products is that they address specific pain points experienced or researched by us.

Here are some examples of what we might build:

- A community hub designed to share various Generative Art made through code
- A productivity app for writers to track word counts and deadlines  
- An automation tool for social media managers to schedule posts across multiple platforms  
- A time tracking app designed specifically for freelancers and consultants  
- A Chrome extension that enhances functionality on popular e-commerce sites

How We Work
---
As a small studio, we operate efficiently and prioritize learning. Here's how we approach each project:

- **Idea Generation** - We generate ideas through research, and brainstorming sessions. We look for opportunities where technology can be used to simplify complex processes or fill gaps in existing markets.  

- **Validation** - Before investing significant resources into any idea, we validate its potential viability by conducting market research, and assessing technical feasibility.  

- **Prototyping & Testing** - If an idea passes initial validation tests, we proceed to prototyping and testing. During this stage, we aim to rapidly iterate over the product until we arrive at a minimum viable product (MVP).  

- **Launch & Growth** - (too soon to say)
